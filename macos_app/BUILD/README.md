This is a quick wrapper around the growlrender bash script to enable non-commandline-users to easily use growlrender

It uses two excellent pieces of software to do so :

* Carsten Bl√ºm's [Pashua](http://www.bluem.net/en/mac/pashua/) which provides a very clean way to generate nice native Aqua dialogs from almost any script language

* Sveinbjorn Thordarson's [Platypus](http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus) which wraps any shell script into a native macos application

If you like this version of growlrender, it's them you ought to thanks :)
