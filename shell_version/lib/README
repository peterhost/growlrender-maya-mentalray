The growlrender daemon needs to set timeouts so that notifications do not saturate the growl buffer.
In order to do that, we need to measure accurately the system time. Shell scripts can't do that with 
POSIX commands, so this is a tiny C utility that prints to the standard output the current unix time
since Epoch, in nanoseconds.

It's already built for Macos. If you need to rebuild it :

gcc -o timeNS timeNS.c
